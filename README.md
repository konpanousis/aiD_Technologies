# aiD project: aRTIFICIAL iNTELLIGENCE for the Deaf

Artificial intelligence opens new frontiers for knowledge on the needs of deaf people and for the creation of 
solutions to improve daily life. The project aimed at the development of 
advanced machine learning technologies applicable to commodity mobile devices to target the majority of potential end users.

The overall aim of the aiD project was to bridge together interdisciplinary research areas and leverage
the latest advances in Machine Learning (ML) to develop and provide a comprehensive suite of vital
solutions that will enable deaf people to effectively communicate and interact with hearing people; this
will significantly contribute to the improvement of their daily social life and opportunities of
participation in various social activities. To realize such a vision, aiD is realized the following
technologies:

1. Sign Language Translation: By leveraging recent advances in Transformer-based architectures, we developed a novel 
stochastic variant towards Sign Language Translation. 
2. Automatic Speech Recognition: For automatic speech recognition, we turned to recent advances in unsupervised cross-lingual models.
3.  Text-to-Speech: For producing realistic synthetic speech, we turned to SOTA architectures, namely Tacotron-2.
4. Sign Language Production: We leverage the latest advances in stable diffusion models towards efficient and realistict production 
of Sign Language videos from text. 

All the implementations can be found in their respective folders. For training the models we leveraged benchmark datasets 
for each respective task, while also taking advantage of the datasets produced and curated in the context of the aiD project.
These are publicly available for further research:

1. Greek Elementary Sign Language Dataset: https://zenodo.org/records/5810460
2. Greek News Sign Language Dataset - Part A: https://zenodo.org/records/5810908

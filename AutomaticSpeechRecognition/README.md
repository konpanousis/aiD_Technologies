# aiD project: The Automatic Speech Recognition Module.

In order to address the ASR challenge within the context of the aiD project, we turned 
to Cross-lingual Speech Recognition (X-LSR). In contrast to most approaches, 
this work approaches the cross-lingual setting using an 
unsupervised representation learning rationale. The main operating principle is for the model 
to learn latent underlying representations on unlabelled data that could potentially allow for 
generalization capacity across other languages. Indeed this approach has been shown to be very effective,
particularly in low resource languages.

The project's aspiration is to provide a holistic generative
system for translating language. Thus, we are interested in the applicability of our
approach to several settings. Thus, for each architecture examined, experiments were conducted in both 
English and Greek language to test the generalization capabilities of the implemented approach.

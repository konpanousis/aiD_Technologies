# aiD project: The Sign Language Production Module.

Sign Language Proudction (SLP) is incredibly important as it
allows deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals to access information and communication that they 
might not otherwise have access to. Just like spoken and written language, SL is a complete and 
complex language that enables expression and communication. However, not everyone can understand 
or use SL, which can lead to social isolation and exclusion for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. 
By providing accurate and effective translation from text to SL, individuals who rely on SL can access 
information on the internet, 
in educational settings, and in daily interactions with others, ultimately promoting inclusivity and equality for all.

Our work, based on the success of [1] on video generation, implements a novel approach for end-to-end text to SL video translation using an autoregressive method which utilizes the power of a video diffusion architecture.
To the best of our knowledge there are no existing models that can directly perform this task, as previous models.
